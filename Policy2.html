                        Housing is something that everyone must think about at some point in their lives. Yet it is unaffordable currently causing home ownership rates to be the lowest it has been in decades. Housing shortages and unaffordable homes can cause overcrowding harming families, fostering inequality worsening the economy and satisfaction of the state of the country.
                    </p>
                    <p class="textcenter">
                    Home ownership is simply not high enough. Two main causes of this are housing shortages and expensive deposits the census shows that there are 300 thousand new houseowners since 2018 but also about 300 thousand new people who do not own a home. Although there are housing shortages the data on this matter is limited. The affordability of homes in terms of deposits have diminished current day deposits are double of what they were in 2022 which makes the first step of house ownership very difficult. As previously mentioned, housing is an inescapable topic in the modern world therefore incredibly important which affects all of NZ.</p>
                    <p class="textcenter">
                    As part of national’s budget 2025 policy, they are planning to deliver 250 million dollars of 10 years to create 650-900 more affordable homes as well as funding the crown lending facility 150 million dollars to lower the borrowing costs for community housing providers reducing overcrowding. Our party believes that 250 million isn’t enough and that the crown lending facility is irrelevant in the context of house ownership as it is not directly correlated to our problem.</p>
                    <p class="textcenter">
                        Our policy on the housing problem is to double the fund from 250 million to 500 million dollars over 10 years. The potential for 900 homes doesn’t seem enough by doubling the fund we can increase house ownership, which can potentially lower homeless rates. It would also reduce potential emigration for those who seek cheaper housing elsewhere retaining likely valuable workers. Society would see change as soon as we implement this policy as it affects everyone. We could also measure the change via the house ownership rates through the census with the prices of houses. This policy would also face similar obstacles like our economy policy. Obstacles such as money to create the fund, verification of the correct use of the fund and how we distribute the fund. These obstacles are not too hard to overcome; overtime we could perfect the process. Again, trialling and testing to find out what works.</p>
                    <p class="textcenter">Home ownership is universally key to our people and our country. The current state of housing and its market is dire. Which is why we will implement our policy. Our policy would be similar to the already existing policy Budget 2025; the National party has created. This policy would be a stronger version of an aspect of Budget 2025 doubling their housing fund. This policy does come with its fair share of issues like ones in our other policy being problems of verification and sourcing the money. The benefits heavily outweigh the potential problems which can potentially improve the economy in a multitude of ways. Through reduced emigration and overall a better view on New Zealand.</p>
