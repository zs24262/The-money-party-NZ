                    <p class="textcenter">
                    Child poverty is a problem that shouldn’t exist. Currently 1 in 7 children live in poverty which harms their health and education Child poverty can negatively impact us all. Children enduring poverty can be stuck in a loop where they never escape maturing uneducated without common sense and understanding of the world which can divert them to a life of crime and confusion. Current benefits too low to cover living costs unable to break the out of the cycle.  If child poverty increases, our country will be tarnished and wouldn’t be pleasant for anyone</p>
                    <p class="textcenter">
                    The existence of child poverty is a problem and can build up over time and can be caused by negligence of people. According to the Stats NZ child poverty is higher than it was 4 years ago and the NZ treasury shows that 12.7 percent of children live with believe 50 percent for the median income in 2024 with an insignificant change between 2024 and 2022 showing that our current policies are ineffective causing this stagnant data. This problem mostly affects poverty-stricken children but can affect all of NZ indirectly. The children in poverty are commonly trapped in cycles where generations of children are poverty stricken unable to change wasting their potential where other circumstances could have allowed them to be functioning members of society.</p>
                    <p class="textcenter">
                    The most prominent policy was the child poverty reduction act of 2018 passed in December 2018 proposed by the Labour party although it was unanimously agreed upon by all parties including National this policy was meant to solve this problem. A lack of action, budget cuts famously the one implemented with Ka Ora Ka Ako changing the budget of school lunches from 8 dollars to 3 dollars combined with late deliveries and poorly quality controlled meals. The act has been proven to be ineffective.</p>
                    <p class="textcenter">
                    Our plan for our policy on child poverty is to increase the school food budget returning to the previous amount or more. Diverting support directly to the children to mitigate foul play from others with background checks. These two acts we plan to enact resolves the previously lowered food budget restoring it back to what it was before. The change for this policy should also be immediate with implemented with children getting filling healthy food at school reducing the suffering the children would have experienced previously. We would be able to check how well this policy is working by the obvious change to positive press on the change. These policies may sound good but there are definitely roadblocks such as in diverging support directly to children and how this would be done, how checks on eligibility would be processed and the facilities that can produce food for schools.</p>
                    <p class="textcenter">
                     Child poverty is a major issue and should not be taken lightly where 12.7% of children live with below 50% of the median income. 12.7% of children whose family may be entangled with poverty for generations. After certain events like budget cuts for school food we have decided to return it to when it was better increasing budgets for school food. We have also decided to experiment with diverging child benefits the child who will be checked. Through these two changes we prepare to take we believe that it would benefit the country greatly even indirectly improving the economy creating a larger workforce with the increase of educated and skilled workers in the future. For a better future and to save children from poverty, voting for us is the choice. </p>
