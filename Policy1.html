                        After the pandemic our economy has endured many hardships and is still affected mostly negatively to this day. A better economy can improve everything for everyone as well as increasing New Zealand’s stand on the global economy as our economy has slowed. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="textcenter">
                    The most prominent cause of the wrecked economy is the COVID pandemic based it closed many businesses and devalued the NZ dollar. Small businesses are a big part of the NZ economy with small businesses making up 97% of the NZ enterprises most facing high costs. After the pandemic inflation started to rise and new rules and regulations were put into place some of which are no longer necessary which makes it harder to grow smaller businesses and hire staff. Small businesses create 42% of economic value add meaning that not only are there many of these small businesses they are not contributing small amounts to the economy. Small businesses are a big part of economy, yet they are ever vulnerable, data shows that the smaller the business is the smaller survival rate they have. Small businesses also contribute to the job market which also boosts the economy with 40% of the jobs being created by small businesses. This problem affects all of NZ in a variety of ways all stemming from the same source, our economy.</p>
                    <p class="textcenter">
                    One of the current policies on this matter put forward by national is the ability for SMEs (Small to medium Enterprises) can deduct 20% of new asset costs on top of depreciation. We believe that this policy could be more lenient and generous. Another national proposed policy was an investment of 6.8B dollars into infrastructure although it is unknown how much this benefits the economy in terms of the small businesses. Finally national also introduced the business investor visa where overseas entrepreneurs can invest 1 million to 2 million NZD to obtain it. This policy is simply not enticing enough for entrepreneurs who would consider NZ investments.</p>
                    <p class="textcenter">
                    The money party’s opinion on this matter is to further increase the percentage of deduction SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) to 25%, the creation of a new fund specifically to fund SMEs on digital ventures and the creation of another fund for SMEs enduring short term hardships. By introducing these acts, the most obvious change would be an economic one, growing it. We may also potentially see many impactful benefits such as the encouragement for development into the digital space therefore growing their businesses, increasing the survivability of SMEs especially during harder times to prevent mass closures and the economic standpoint during the COVID pandemic from reoccurring. Although these policies will be most impactful during similar situations as the COVID pandemic put us in. Yet our policies will still be relatively positively impactful to SMEs of which many livelihoods are built upon. As soon as this policy is implemented as SMEs are a big part of the economy the change should be immediate but not instantly visible. Of course, the policy has its fair share of obstacles mainly with the acquirement of money, but another serious obstacle is the verification of those who claim money from these funds and refunds. Societally there could be pushback from larger companies where such policies would not benefit them increasing competition but in thinking of the majority this will mostly affect everyone positively. Honestly, we would have to test out different methods for each of obstacles but these obstacles are not severely impactful we could acquire the money over a period of time delaying the implementation, verification would be set and adjusted during testing phases and large company pushback is negligible as can people overpower corporations. We plan to allocate an initial 500 million New Zealand Dollar for 3 years whilst reviewing the changes each year to test. We would also need to cooperate with the Inland Revenue Department to process refunds as well as the businesses themselves.</p>
                    <p class="textcenter">
                    New Zealand’s economy has struggled to recover from the negative impacts of the COVID pandemic, SMEs crucial part of the economy has suffered the most, yet their survival and growth remain one of the most important for economy affecting us all. Our policy provides a stronger solution to this lasting problem, by increasing tax deductions for SMEs to 25% creating funds to support digital ventures and businesses through hard times. Our policy can create jobs and strengthen the economy although some obstacles may arise, through trials we can experiment and find out what works for our country. This policy is an investment for our people and economy. Our support for selected aspects can empower communities, families, and the future of New Zealand. Voting for us will allow you to be put first.</p>
